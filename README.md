## User Guide of Wavelets Interpolation

#### 1. Project Description
This project offers a interpolation tool built up with wavelets and allow users to interpolate data.

#### 2. How to use the program
It is an easy program in python, set all the functions ready, and 3 inputs are needed for the function interpolation(). An array of abscissae of sample points, an array of ordinates of sample points and an independent varibale(the abscissa of the point user want to interpolate). This gives the ordinate of the point that user want to interpolate given the sample points.
Also, if user want to compare the interpolating function with some original function where the sample points are selected from, plotinterp() can give a plot of which.
